# **GHL Growth Tools Zapier App**

This repository contains custom Zapier app configurations and examples for **GHL Growth Tools**, designed to extend the functionality of **GoHighLevel** by enabling seamless automation through Zapier.

---

## **Overview**

The **GHL Growth Tools Zapier app** enables users to:
- Automate common tasks and workflows in GoHighLevel.
- Configure user-specific settings such as business hours.
- Seamlessly integrate GoHighLevel data with other apps using Zapier.

## **Features**

- **Business Hours Configuration**:  
  Define user-specific business hours for precise scheduling and availability management.  
  Due to Zapier's limitations with nested JSON structures, we’ve provided examples and guidelines on how to correctly pass certain paramaters using structured JSON on our custom app.
